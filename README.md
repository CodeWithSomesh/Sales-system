Write a program that will: <br>
⭐ Ask the user to enter the employee’s name. <br>
⭐ Ask the user to input a Tier. It should accept B, M, P, b, m, or p. In other words, the user may use either upper or lower case designations for the tier. <br>
⭐ Ask the user to input the base salary for the employee, and read it as a double.  <br>
⭐ Ask the user for the number of items sold, and read that value as an integer.  <br>
⭐ Based on the tier, base salary, and number of items sold, compute and report the monthly pay.  <br>
⭐ Print out the name, tier, number of items sold, and payment for the month. If a message is necessary print it.
